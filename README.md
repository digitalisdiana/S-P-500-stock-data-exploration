# S&P500 Data Analysis

This is inspired by the guided project "Python for Finance" by pythonprogramming.net.

The different Python files and their contents are :

- pythonforfinance1.py

This is the introductory part of the project; it explores aspects such as retrieving stock price data, graphing and handling data as well as techniques of stock data manipulation.
To simplify the process, we have only used data from one company : Amazon. This introduction prepares us for what is to come : manipulating stock data for multiple entities of a market or across markets.

- pythonforfinance2.py

Here we start an exploration of data points for a greater list of companies. We first consult the list of S&P from wikipedia
